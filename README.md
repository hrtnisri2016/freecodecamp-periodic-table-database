# Periodic Table Database (freecodecamp project)
This is one of the projects required to earn the freeCodeCamp Relational Databases certification. I fixed some mistakes in the database and wrote a small bash program to retrieve chemical element information from a periodic table database. I also learned how to keep track of all the changes I made to the file because the code must be version controlled with git.
